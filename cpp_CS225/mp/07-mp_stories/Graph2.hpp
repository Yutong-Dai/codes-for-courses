/**
 * Returns an std::list of vertex keys that creates any shortest path between `start` and `end`.
 *
 * This list MUST include the key of the `start` vertex as the first vertex in the list, the key of
 * the `end` vertex as the last element in the list, and an ordered list of all vertices that must
 * be traveled along the shortest path.
 * 
 * For example, the path a -> c -> e returns a list with three elements: "a", "c", "e".
 * 
 * You should use undirected edges. Hint: There are no edge weights in the Graph.
 *
 * @param start The key for the starting vertex.
 * @param end   The key for the ending vertex.
